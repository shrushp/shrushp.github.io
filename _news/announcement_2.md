Firstly, I enjoyed my thesis throughout the year. It was a wonderful experience full
of excitement, frustrations, ups, downs (mostly downs), and self-discovery but yeah
it was worth it. First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge my supervisor Prof.
Prasanta Panigrahi for his unwavering support and for giving me time-to-time valuable
suggestions to improve my work. I am also grateful to Shreya di for bearing me for a
whole year! and for her patient guidance during the times when I felt intimidated
as a novice in the field. It got better with time because of her. Now comes the most
important part, I am grateful to my mumma, papa, nana, nani, and dadu for believing
in me, loving me unconditionally, and always letting me do whatever I am interested
in. I am thankful to my best friends Shekhar and Sumana for listening to my crying
and ‘Dude my result is not coming’ episodes. I love them for not abandoning me
and they are the best thing that ever happened to me. I owe my deepest gratitude
to Ananyapam for bearing with me during times when I was not easy to be with. I
am thankful to him for being my home where everything was new. I would also like
to show my gratitude to Arman Bhaiyya for providing me with his great company
and his constant support despite all my tantrums. Finally, I am thankful to all my
labmates for the fruitful discussions.
