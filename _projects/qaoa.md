For my thesis, I joined lab of Prof. Prasanta Panigrahi at IISER Kolkata and worked on solving large scale combinatorial optimization problems through clustering methods.

Together, we developed two novel clustering algorithms, one being a quantum algorithm following divisive approach and the other being inspired by unsharp measurements. Following blocks show the workflow of developed algorithms. 

## Heirarchical Quantum Clustering Algorithm

{% raw %}
```python
    Input: {D_{k_1i}}, n, m
    Output:  k  clusters
    initialization
    Construct the state  |Ïˆ>
    for num_clusters !=  k 
    |    apply  U  on n + m register if num clusters = k then
    |    |   Return: Output
    |    else
    |    |    further split the clusters by applying U or merege until num clusters = k
    |    end
    end

```
{% endraw %}

## Unsharp measurement based Clustering Algorithm

{% raw %}
```python
    Input: {D_{k_1i}}, n
    Output: k clusters
    initialization
    Construct the superposed quantum state as described
    for cluster around point i do
    |    measure state unsharply around i if num clusters = k
    |    then
    |    |    Return: Output
    |    else
    |    |    re-center the next distance j at i and measure until num clusters = k
    |    end
    end
```
{% endraw %}

We implemented them on various datasest for the benchmarking purpose and found that it outperforms state-of-the-art quantum clustering algorithms as well as classical divisive clustering. Below are the results.

The main goal of thesis was to solve large scale graph problems like TSP; we employed two methods:

(i) one is implenting developed algorithms to  cluster the nearby cities in TSP data.

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/city_data.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/city_out.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

(ii) and the second using tensor networks.
