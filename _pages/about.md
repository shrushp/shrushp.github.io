Hi there! I'm Srushti, currently a Research Assistant at IIT-Bombay, working on Many-body inspired quantum circuit compactification and associated error mitigation. I graduated a few months back from IISER Tirupati with a MS in Physics. My research interests are in the areas of Quantum Algorithms, Quantum ML, and Quantum Cryptography. 

During my highschool years, I used to love solving Physics problems like finding the charge on a hollow sphere or the crazy relative velocity ones! When I first learned about Kepler's Laws, I was awstruck by the very idea of planets following trajectories and how intact is everything, not too big, not too small, just perfect! And we can actually do some math about it!(There is a [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s78hvV3QLUE&t=2149s) of Lex Fridman with Leonard Susskind which touches the math part very beautifully) This led me to pursue my career in Physics as major durig my undergraduate years.

I am always open to discuss physics and any wild ideas that come to your mind! I love [One Direction](https://www.youtube.com/@onedirectionchannel) btw! .. and a bit of [The Lumineers](https://www.youtube.com/@TheLumineers) too!

Next stop: PhD?
