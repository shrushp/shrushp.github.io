Hi there! I'm Srushti, currently a Research Assistant at IIT-Bombay, working on Many-body inspired quantum circuit compactification and associated error mitigation. I graduated a few months back from IISER Tirupati with a MS in Physics. My research interests are in the areas of Quantum Algorithms, Quantum ML, and Quantum Cryptography. 


Next stop: PhD?
